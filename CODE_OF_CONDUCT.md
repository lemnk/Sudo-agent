# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

## Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the maintainers privately.

Recommended options:
- Contact the maintainer(s) via their GitHub profile (email on profile) or direct message.
- If you are uncomfortable doing that, open an issue requesting a private contact channel.
